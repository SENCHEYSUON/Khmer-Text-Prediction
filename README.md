# Khmer-Text-Prediction
+ Description:
This project aims to develop a system that predicts the next word or suggests possible words as
the user types in Khmer. Will investigate both statistical and deep learning approaches and
examine the challenges in predicting Khmer words due to spacing issues, compound structures,
and orthographic variants.
+ Key Tasks:
• Collect Khmer text corpus (news, social media, literature)
• Preprocess the data: tokenization, sentence segmentation
• Compare models:
o N-gram language models
o RNN/LSTM/GRU models
o Transformer-based models (GPT-style, mBERT, mT5)
• Implement a simple demo: keyboard auto-suggestion or sentence completion
• Evaluate accuracy and relevance of predictions
